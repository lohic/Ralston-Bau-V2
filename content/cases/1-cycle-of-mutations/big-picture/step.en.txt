Emergence - september 27.09.2007 to 28.02 2008
Emergence was the first mutation, it is how everything begun. Emergence led us to notice the passage of the inside to outdoors, of underground to overground, of underwater to cool air. Seeds sprouted and broke through while unseen forms and new ideas came into sight. Something new was born and alive. The young changed the fate of the old. Emergence worked on the new, the young and the unexpected.

Growth - 29.02.2008 to 31.08.2008
The second mutation, was the period of evolving. What had just appeared stretched and rose to take a new shape. It was the stage of a dramatic change. The creation invaded the space as time went by. The walls were the canvas for paintings and collages which were added by different artists and designers dur- ing the theme. Vegetation was growing and mutating in niches and changed as well the face of Transplant from the spring until the late summer.

Maturation - 12.09.2008 to February 2009
The third maturation was the phase
of refinement. It was the substance ripening and defining.The materiality and presence was at it ÃÅs peak as a new aesthetic impregnated the present form. Maturation was the phase of dwelling in a moment without past and future. A phase in which the dialog between creator and viewer was intimate and personal.

Disappearance - 06.03.2009 to 15.08.2009
The fourth maturation, was the stage which closed again the cycle. The aim was reached and the track ended. Alone traces and memories remained present. Disappearance was the transition of the visible in the invisible, of completed presence to the absence. The artists and designers passed their memories and inspired to reflect. The viewer became surrounded by invisibility an actor on its own who was able to study from the vanished to express something new.
